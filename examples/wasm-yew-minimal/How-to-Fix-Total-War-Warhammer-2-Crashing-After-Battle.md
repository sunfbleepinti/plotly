In this article, we will show you how to fix Total War: Warhammer 2 crashing after battle with 8 easy steps. These steps include checking your PC specs, running the game as an administrator, updating or rolling back your graphics driver, verifying the integrity of your game files, running the game with DirectX 11, checking for Windows Firewall, running the game in compatibility mode, and reinstalling Steam. Follow these steps carefully and hopefully you will be able to play the game without any crashes.
 
## Step 1: Check your PC specs
 
The first thing you should do is to make sure that your PC meets the minimum system requirements to run Total War: Warhammer 2. The game is very demanding and won't work well if your PC can't handle it. The minimum system requirements are:
 
- OS: Windows 7 64Bit
- Processor: IntelÂ® Coreâ¢ 2 Duo 3.0Ghz
- Memory: 5 GB RAM
- Graphics: NVIDIA GTX 460 1GB | AMD Radeon HD 5770 1GB | Intel HD4000 @720p
- Storage: 60 GB available space

You can check your PC specs by following these steps:

1. On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key and R at the same time.
2. Type dxdiag and click OK.
3. Check your operating system, processor, and memory.
4. Click the Display tab, and then check your graphics card's information.

If your PC meets the minimum specs, then proceed to the next step. If not, you may need to upgrade your PC or lower your graphics settings in the game.
 
## Step 2: Run your game as an administrator
 
Sometimes, Total War: Warhammer 2 may crash after a battle because it doesn't have enough permissions to access certain files or folders on your PC. To fix this, you can try running the game as an administrator. This will give the game full access to your system resources and prevent any potential conflicts. Here is how to do it:

1. Exit Steam.
2. Right-click the Steam icon and select Properties.
3. Click the Compatibility tab, then check Run this program as an administrator and click OK.
4. Restart Total War: Warhammer 2 from Steam.

If this doesn't work, move on to the next step.
 
## Step 3: Update or roll back your graphics driver
 
Your graphics driver is a crucial component that determines how well your PC can run games. If you have an outdated or faulty graphics driver, you may experience crashes or other performance issues in Total War: Warhammer 2. To fix this, you need to update or roll back your graphics driver depending on your situation.
 
If you have recently updated your graphics driver and the game started to crash after that, it's possible that the new driver is incompatible with your game. In this case, you can try rolling back your graphics driver to a previous version that worked well with Total War: Warhammer 2. Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key and R at the same time.
2. Type devmgmt.msc and click OK.
3. Expand Display adapters and right-click your graphics card.
4. Select Properties and click the Driver tab.
5. Click Roll Back Driver and follow the on-screen instructions.
6. Restart your PC and launch Total War: Warhammer 2 again.

If you haven't updated your graphics driver for a long time or you don't know when was the last time you did it, it's
